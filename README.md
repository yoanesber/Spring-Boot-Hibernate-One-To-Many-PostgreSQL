# REST API Spring Boot One To Many example with Hibernate and PostgreSQL  

Implement JPA/Hibernate **One-To-Many** mapping with **Hibernate** in a Spring Boot CRUD example using `@OneToMany` annotation.  

## üìñ Overview  

This project is a REST API built using **Spring Boot** to handle CRUD operations for **Employee** and **Department** entities. The project integrates **Spring Data JPA with Hibernate** as the default JPA provider and uses **PostgreSQL** as the database. It also includes a custom HTTP response and a **custom error controller** to override the default `/error` response.  

This project implements `One-To-Many` relationships between **Employee** as the parent entity and the child entities **DepartmentEmployee, SalaryEmployee, and TitleEmployee**. The relationship is managed using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate, and the project utilizes `EmbeddedId` for `composite primary keys` in the relationship tables.

## ‚öô Environment Configuration  

The application uses externalized configuration via Spring Boot's `application.properties` file, leveraging environment variables to support flexible deployment across different environments (development, staging, production, etc.).  

Below is a breakdown of the key configurations:  

```properties
# Application environment variables
spring.application.name=one-to-many-postgresql
server.port=${APP_PORT}
spring.profiles.active=${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE}

# Database properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PORT}/${SPRING_DATASOURCE_DB}?currentSchema==${SPRING_DATASOURCE_SCHEMA}
spring.datasource.username=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
```

## üíæ Database Schema (DDL ‚Äì PostgreSQL)  

The following is the database schema for the PostgreSQL database used in this project:  

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA your_schema;

-- table your_schema.employee
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.employee (
    id bigint NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ( INCREMENT 1 START 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807 CACHE 1 ),
    birth_date date NOT NULL,
    first_name character varying(20) NOT NULL,
    last_name character varying(20),
    gender character varying(1) NOT NULL,
    hire_date date NOT NULL,
    active boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL,
    created_by bigint NOT NULL,
    created_date timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_by bigint NOT NULL,
    updated_date timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT employee_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
);

-- table your_schema.department
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.department (
    id character varying(4) NOT NULL,
    dept_name character varying(40) NOT NULL,
    active boolean NOT NULL,
    created_by bigint NOT NULL,
    created_date timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_by bigint NOT NULL,
    updated_date timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT department_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- table your_schema.department_employee
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.department_employee (
    employee_id bigint NOT NULL,
    department_id character varying(255) NOT NULL,
    from_date date NOT NULL,
    to_date date NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT department_employee_pkey PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, department_id),
    CONSTRAINT department_employee_fkey1 FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES your_schema.employee(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT department_employee_fkey2 FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES your_schema.department(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE
);


-- table your_schema.salary
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.salary (
    employee_id bigint NOT NULL,
    amount bigint NOT NULL,
    from_date date NOT NULL,
    to_date date NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT salary_pkey PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, from_date),
    CONSTRAINT salary_fkey FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES your_schema.employee(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- table your_schema.title
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.title (
    employee_id bigint NOT NULL,
    title character varying(50) NOT NULL,
    from_date date NOT NULL,
    to_date date,
    CONSTRAINT title_pkey PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, title, from_date),
    CONSTRAINT title_fkey FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES your_schema.employee(id) ON UPDATE RESTRICT ON DELETE CASCADE
);

```

### üîó Relationships  

The following is the relationship between tables:  

- Department ‚Üî DepartmentEmployee (`One-to-Many`)
- Employee ‚Üî DepartmentEmployee (`One-to-Many`)
- Employee ‚Üî SalaryEmployee (`One-to-Many`)
- Employee ‚Üî TitleEmployee (`One-to-Many`)

### üî¢ EmbeddedId  

These tables are managed using `EmbeddedId` to define composite primary keys:  

- department_employee (employee_id, department_id)
- salary (employee_id, from_date)
- title (employee_id, title, from_date)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup  

To get started with the **REST API Spring Boot One To Many example with Hibernate and PostgreSQL**, follow the steps below to configure your environment properly.  

1. Ensure you have **Git installed on your Windows** machine, then clone the repository to your local environment:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoanesber/Spring-Boot-Hibernate-One-To-Many-PostgreSQL.git
cd Spring-Boot-Hibernate-One-To-Many-PostgreSQL
```

2. Set up PostgreSQL  

The application connects to a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of employee, department, salary, and title data.  

- Run the provided DDL script to set up the database schema
- Configure the connection in `.env.development` file:  

```properties
# Database properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PORT}/${SPRING_DATASOURCE_DB}?currentSchema==${SPRING_DATASOURCE_SCHEMA}
spring.datasource.username=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
```

Once configured, make sure the PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible before starting the Spring Boot application.  

3. Run the application locally
Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then execute:  

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

4. Now, API is available at:  

```bash
http://localhost:8081/ 
```

You can test the API using: Postman (Desktop/Web version) or cURL

## üìù Notes & Future Enhancements  

### Current Notes  

- This project demonstrates a **RESTful API implementation using Spring Boot** to model and manage a **One-to-Many relationship** using **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate**.  
- The underlying database is **PostgreSQL**, with schema relationships mapped via JPA annotations (e.g., `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@JoinColumn`).  
- The API provides full **CRUD operations** on parent and child entities using Spring Boot's REST controller support.  
- This is a foundational project focused on relational data modeling and persistence ‚Äî **no authentication or authorization mechanism** is implemented yet.  


### Planned Enhancements  

- **Implement Security Layer**  

Add **Spring Security** or **JWT-based authentication** to secure REST endpoints and restrict access to sensitive data.  

- **GraphQL Subscriptions**  

Implement **GraphQL subscriptions** to enable real-time notifications when an employee is created, updated, or deleted. This would be useful for reactive client-side applications.
